### About Me
Software developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, building enterprise and AI solutions while pursuing MSc in Computer Science at UT Austin.

I enjoy crafting both practical and experimental projects - from bioinformatics visualization to random software/AI experiments. When not coding, you'll probably find me on the football field, buried in a book, or playing my guitar.
