description: Programming Language Implementation
---

- Translates a Java-like language to SaM assembly code, implementing core features like arithmetic operations, control flow statements, and method declarations.
- Uses virtual method tables and supports object-oriented programming constructs, though inheritance is not yet implemented.
- Features a multi-pass compilation process with comprehensive symbol table management, type checking, and error handling for reliable code generation.
